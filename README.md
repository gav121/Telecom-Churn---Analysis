# Telecom-Churn---Analysis

**INTRODUCTION**

The telecommunications sector has become one of the largest industries in the developed world. Technological advancement and a growing number of users have increased the level of competition. Companies are working hard to survive in this competitive market based on a number of strategies. Three major strategies for generating additional revenue are proposed: - (a.) Acquiring new customers, (b.) Selling existing customers, and (c.) Extending the customer term. However, comparing these strategies by taking the amount of return on investment (RoI) per account showed that a third strategy is more profitable, proving that retaining an existing customer costs much less than getting a new one, moreover being considered much easier than a marketing strategy. In order to implement the third strategy, companies must reduce the power of customer exchange, known as "customer movement from one provider to another".

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
In the telecommunications industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry is experiencing an average of  Churn between 15-25% per annum. Considering the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to find a new customer than an existing one, customer retention is now more important than customer acquisition. 
For many potential users, keeping customers with high profits is the first goal of the business. 
In order to reduce customer overcrowding, telecommunications companies need to predict which customers are most at risk of withdrawal.
In this project, you will analyze the customer data of a leading telecom firm, create predictable models to identify customers at high risk of extinction and identify key churn indicators.



**APPROACH**
In this project we have done analysis on orange sa company dataset

so by that dataset wereach to some conclusion as follows-

**** CONCLUSION****


By the above analysis we get the following conclusions :

From the 'CHURNED CUSTOMER'S CHART' we found that the churn rate is 14.5%.The average Churn rate for Telecom company should be 20-25%.So here Churn rate is good.

The graph 'State Wise Percentage Churn' and 'State wise avg charges' indicate that although state 'CA' has maximum churn rate, lowest customer but avg local charges are relatively more as compared to other states.

By Refering to 'Price Different Count' chart we conclude that intl charge per minute is very much higher than the local charge per minute.

Chart 'No. of customers acc. to Total charges' clearly shows churn rate is maximum when total charges exceeds more than '74'.

From "Analysing churn with customer service calls" it is pretty much clear that The churn rate is more when customer service calls exceed '4'.It also shows that churned customer much more than the existing customer.

From "Voice Mail Analysis" it is found that when the number of voice mail increase 20, there is churning. This may be due to Quality of Voice Mail.

From the scatter plot 'Local Charge Per Minute' , We Conclude Day charges,eve charges,night charges are not same.

By comparing 'Churn vs Intl plan' it is concluded that 50% of the people get churned those take the intl plan.It may be due to higher charges or may be due to network issue.

 **SUGGESTION
 **
 
Local charges are not same for all states so to reduce churn rate the company should make Local charge uniform in all states.

we observe that more churn is due to expensive intl charge per minute so it should reduce its intl charge to reduce churn rate.

In some particular states churn rate is much higher than that of others may be due to network issues.So It should focus on these states to reduce churn rate.

It should improve its customer service .
