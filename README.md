# Telecom-Churn---Analysis
In this project we have done analysis on orange sa company dataset

so by that dataset wereach to some conclusion as follows-

**** CONCLUSION****


By the above analysis we get the following conclusions :

From the 'CHURNED CUSTOMER'S CHART' we found that the churn rate is 14.5%.The average Churn rate for Telecom company should be 20-25%.So here Churn rate is good.

The graph 'State Wise Percentage Churn' and 'State wise avg charges' indicate that although state 'CA' has maximum churn rate, lowest customer but avg local charges are relatively more as compared to other states.

By Refering to 'Price Different Count' chart we conclude that intl charge per minute is very much higher than the local charge per minute.

Chart 'No. of customers acc. to Total charges' clearly shows churn rate is maximum when total charges exceeds more than '74'.

From "Analysing churn with customer service calls" it is pretty much clear that The churn rate is more when customer service calls exceed '4'.It also shows that churned customer much more than the existing customer.

From "Voice Mail Analysis" it is found that when the number of voice mail increase 20, there is churning. This may be due to Quality of Voice Mail.

From the scatter plot 'Local Charge Per Minute' , We Conclude Day charges,eve charges,night charges are not same.

By comparing 'Churn vs Intl plan' it is concluded that 50% of the people get churned those take the intl plan.It may be due to higher charges or may be due to network issue.

 **SUGGESTION
 **
 
Local charges are not same for all states so to reduce churn rate the company should make Local charge uniform in all states.

we observe that more churn is due to expensive intl charge per minute so it should reduce its intl charge to reduce churn rate.

In some particular states churn rate is much higher than that of others may be due to network issues.So It should focus on these states to reduce churn rate.

It should improve its customer service .
